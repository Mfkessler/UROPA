Overview
========

There are already different peak annotation tools, like HOMER or ChIPpeakAnno,
but with none of them it is so easy to suit the annotation to your currant analysis. 
UROPA was developed as an open source analysis pipeline for peaks generated from any 
peak caller, e.g. MUSIC, originating from any of the existing methods of accessible
chromatin-based sequencing, as ChIP-seq or ATAC-seq.

Advantages of UROPA
===================
* Easy usage with the help of a configuration file
* Simple customization by this config file
* Usage of all available gtf files as annotation database
* Usage of custom annotation with internal transformation to gtf file format
* Different filtering steps, e.g. for features or attribute types
* One run with multiple sets of parameters by multiple queries
* Detect the most appropriate annotation with flexible arguments that allow robustness
* Different output formats: Display best annotation corresponding to your configuration, presentation of all possible annotations
* ...
