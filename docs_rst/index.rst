Welcome to the UROPA documentation!
===================================
UROPA is a command line based tool, intended for genomic region
annotation. Based on a configuration file, different target features can
be prioritized with multiple integrated queries. These can be sensitive
for feature type, distance, strand specificity, feature attributes (eg.
protein_coding) or the anchor position relative to the feature. UROPA
can incorporate reference annotation files (GTF) from different sources,
like Gencode, Ensembl, or RefSeq, as well as custom reference files
produced by the user.
